About Me
-----
I have been interested in technology since my early youth when my dad purchased a subscription to <a href="http://www.popsci.com/" target="_blank">Popular Science Magazine</a> for my brother and me.  I remember imagining how cool the world would be when scientists could make the machines and computers they were designing.  Fast forward a decade later, and I was building my first computer with an Intel Pentium III 500MHz Processor.  In 1996, I got the itch for coding by making fan websites for bands and starting an online magazine.  I recall how exciting it was to see my code trigger a song to play within a webpage for the first time.

A nerd was born.

I decided to pursue a Computer Science degree at California State University, Chico, where I continued to build and repair computers as part of the Information Technology Support staff. After graduating from college, I worked as a Software Engineer at Chevron, AT&T, and Comcast.  I now have the taste of developing and deploying applications to 30+ million users across the United States and am hungry to do more.

I have moved into Product Management from the role of Engineering Manager, and I love it!  I enjoy being hands-on technically with designing and coding and working toward a common vision with my team members.

When I am not coding or doing research, you can find me hanging out with my wife or out mountain biking, shooting photos, reading, or hunting for the perfect cup of coffee.
